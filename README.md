# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning

A data cleaning project using Nashville Housing Data 🏡🌇. This project involved extracting and cleaning raw data to make it usable for further analysis.

Using SQL, I was able to identify and remove duplicates, fill in missing values, and standardize data formats. The end result was a clean, organized dataset ready for further analysis and visualization.

Data cleaning may not be the most glamorous task, but it's an essential step in any data-driven project. Without clean data, any insights or conclusions drawn from the data could be inaccurate or misleading.
